Running:
run `python3 server.py` on the same local network as the Bose SoundTouch enabled device. Make sure code points to the correct IP.

You'll need several pip packages installed, including google-cloud-texttospeech, xmltodict, websocket-client.
You'll also need GCP credentials (see texttospeech.py for environment variable)
